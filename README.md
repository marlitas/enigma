# enigma

## functionality
**meets expectations**

Encrypt and decrypt methods are fully implemented with successful file io implementation and command line interface. 

## object oriented programming
**meets expectations**

According to rubric modules and inheritance are needed for above expectations, however modules and inheritance do not feel necessary in the manner I structured this project. Each class is responsible for specific tasks, and methods are not trying to do too much in one. 

## ruby conventions and mechanics
**above expectations**

syntax and indentation is correct (to my eye). After refactoring I believe the proper enumerables and built in methods were chosen to get the work done. I also believe that the majority of methods are both efficient and readable. 

## test driven development
**meets expectations**

Testing drove the development of classes and methods. Testing is passing at 100% coverage with simplecov. Mocks and stubs used for testing methods dealing with date class. No mocks and stubs used for randomization. Edge cases covered in testing.
